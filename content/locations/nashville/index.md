## Who runs it?

- [Brian Dailey](https://dailey.pag://dailey.page/about/)
- It all started with [this LinkedIn
  post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/briandailey_why-arent-more-companies-in-the-southeast-activity-7138218767964098560-Dksp)
  and many discussions with local engineers. I want to see more engineers who are
  considering starting a company take the plunge.

## Why Nashville?

- Nashville is pretty great. We have a very collaborative community and a lot of
  smart engineers.
- The Nashville Entrepreneur Center have a corner on the MBA/suits, but the
  overlap between "startup biz-types" and "engineers" is pretty small.
- Tennessee is pretty business friendly, all things considered.

## What does this group look like?

Right now (as of January 2024) it's super informal. That means we hang out in a private chat room on
an already-existing [Slack group that many are already on](https://nashdev.com)
(which does mean we are also subject to their CoC). We have adhoc get togethers
coordinated by Brian.

As we determine the level of interest, we can develop more structure.

## How do I apply?

Coming soon. :)

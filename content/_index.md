If you...

- Have a background in software development
- Have an interest in building your own company

...then you are a **tech founder**.

If you are a tech founder living in or near Nashville, Tennessee (our current 
area of focus) then this is the community for you.

---

The goal of this community is to encourage and enable engineers to leverage
their technical and domain expertise to build a thriving business. We do this by
connecting interested folks in local networks with peers, mentors, advisors, and
maybe even capital.

## What do you mean by "founder"?

For the purposes of this group, "founder" refers to anyone participating in the
earliest stages of creating a company. It could mean an indie hacker, solopreneur, 
or technical co-founder.

Importantly, this group is not focused on founders of a specific _type_ of company. 
Whether you're building a software-as-a-service business or a pure service offering
(e.g., coaching and consulting), we're here for it. Of course, different types 
of businesses often require different strategies, so we imagine a constellation
of subgroups to support specific pursuits.

What this group is _not_ for: marketing and selling your product or services to
group members.

## How does it work, who owns it?

No one owns it. Tech Founder Community is modeled after [OpenCoffee
Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCoffee_Club) in that it is an [open
concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_knowledge) with a very informal,
loose structure.

## What's in it for me?

The way we hope to support tech founders is through:

- In-person meetups
- Peer encouragement and advice
- Advice from veteran founders
- A collection of recommended resources
- Discussion panels, guest speakers, etc.

# Interested?

As of January 2024, Tech Founder Community is very much an experiment. It is
currently spearheaded by [Brian Dailey](https://dailey.page/) and is only
available in [Nashville, Tennessee](/locations/nashville).

Great!  If you this sounds like a group you'd be interested in, take a look at
the [Membership](/membership) page.

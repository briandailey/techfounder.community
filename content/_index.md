If you...

- Have a background in software development
- Have an interest in building your own company
- _Live in or near Nashville, Tennessee (our current area of focus)_

...then you are a **tech founder**, and this is the community for you.

The goal of this community is to encourage and enable engineers to leverage
their technical and domain expertise to build a thriving business. We do this by
connecting interested folks in local networks with peers, mentors, advisors, and
maybe even capital.

Tech Founder Community is modeled after [OpenCoffee
Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCoffee_Club) in that it is an [open
concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_knowledge) with a very informal,
loose structure.

The way we hope to support tech founders is through:

- In-person meetups
- Peer encouragement and advice
- Advice from veteran founders
- A collection of recommended resources
- Discussion panels, guest speakers, etc.

As of January 2024, Tech Founder Community is very much an experiment. It is
currently spearheaded by [Brian Dailey](https://dailey.page/) and is only
available in [Nashville, Tennessee](/location/nashville).

## What do you mean by "founder"?

For the purposes of this group, we acknowledge that 'founder' could include a
wide variety of things, ranging from software-as-a-service to pure service
offerings (e.g., coaching and consulting). It could mean being a solopreneur or
a technical co-founder.

While different kinds of businesses often require different approaches, we hope
that this group can encompass any of the above, with subgroups that can provide
guidance and advice to those interested in a specific line of business.

What this group is _not_ for: marketing and selling your product or services to
group members.
